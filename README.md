# hashtagGuessr

 HashtagGuessr is a social game where you compete against others to guess the hottest hashtag on twitter right now.
 It is for the moment a pretty crude prototype so it is still riddled with bugs.
 Technologies involved are Sails.js, AngularJs and Twitters streaming API.
 Before making this game I had very little experience in web app development and I wanted to create something that used real time updates together with some external API.
 A live demo of the application can be found on [sennerby.se:1337](sennerby.se:1337) but as I mentioned, it is still riddled with bugs!
